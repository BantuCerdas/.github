# Bantu Cerdas: Empowering Education Together
BantuCerdas emerges as a solution to address educational disparities, particularly among children who have not been fully reached by programs like Kartu Indonesia Pintar. The application focuses on providing access to less privileged children to obtain school essentials, including school uniforms, which often pose a financial burden. BantuCerdas facilitates the donation of gently used or new school supplies through a user-friendly platform. By engaging individuals and communities, BantuCerdas creates opportunities for those who wish to make a tangible contribution to the education of needy children. Through transparency, collaboration, and collective support, BantuCerdas serves as a platform to realize a brighter future through equal education.
